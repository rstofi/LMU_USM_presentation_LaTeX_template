# LaTeX beamer template for presentations as an LMU researcher
---

This is an __unnoficial LaTeX teplate__ for presentations given as LMU folks.

The template is basically the copy-paste of templates I made previously for various institutes and teams. As such, it is made with a quick&dirty attitude.

TO DO: create a script that can generate templates based on color and logo(s).
